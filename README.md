# Game Programming in C++

This is a repository for the S.I.G. of Videogame Development from ACM - UTEC to collectively read and work on the assignments from the book **Game Programming in C++: Creating 3D Games** by Sanjay Madhav.

This repository is divided in two main parts:

* Summaries: In charge of  <a href="https://github.com/DiegoELT">DiegoELT</a>
* Assignments: In which all the S.I.G. members participate.

We will be also be keeping a log of the readings that are being done, as well as the assignments so anyone who wishes to keep up, can do so.

## How to submit assignments

To clone the repository, and work in a new assignment, you can follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/acm-utec/Game-Programming-Madhav.git

# Go into the repository's assignment directory
$ cd Game-Programming-Madhav/assignments

# Enter the corresponding assignment's directory, or create one if non-existent
$ mkdir <relevantName>_<chapterNumber>_<number>

# Inside this directory, create one with your (nick)name
$ mkdir <username>

# And cd into it.
```

In this new directory you can work as however you please to complete the assignment, just try to be careful with some auxiliary files, and include them in the `.gitignore`
